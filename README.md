# ❤️ Heart Disease Classification using Machine Learning

## 📘 Overview

This repository presents a project for **classifying heart disease** using both **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)** models, trained on the **UCI Heart Disease Dataset**.  
The aim is to support medical professionals with accurate, data-driven predictions.

> 🏆 **Best Performance:** GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) with **92.4% accuracy**

## 🔁 Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values
   - Normalize / Scale data
   - Encode categorical variables
2. **Model Training**
   - Train/test split
   - Fit models
3. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Visualization of metrics
