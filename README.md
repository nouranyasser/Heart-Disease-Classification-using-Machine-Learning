❤️ Heart Disease Classification using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using various Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. By leveraging the UCI Heart Disease dataset, we developed and evaluated multiple models to assist in early diagnosis and healthcare decision-making.

    Best Model: GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) — achieved 92.4% accuracy
